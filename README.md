## Step by Step Process

* The data was extracted from Kaggle, cleaned and merged using jupyter notebook and converted to sql

* Created a barchart to showcase the overview of public and private tuition in universities throughout the US

* Created a scatter plot with a dropdown box to choose between: early, intermediate income to showcase an overview of tuition vs income

* Created our interactive tool, a bubble chart, where the user can change the Y-axis depending if they want to see tuition againt grad rate, early income, etc

* Created a bullet chart so the user would be able to individually pick a university and look at it more closely in terms of tuition, acceptance rate, grad rate, etc

* Used flask to create a website that could be run locally
